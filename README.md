silent-wars was first developed as a browsergame in 2002. back then without any javascript.
this new attempt is to bring silent-wars back to life and also freshing up the code with 
some state of the art technologies. 
the game is a classic strategy browsergame where you have to develop your country, gather
resources and build and army to defeat your enemies once and for all to bring glory and
treasure to yourself and your people.
